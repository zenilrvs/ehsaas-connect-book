                 At Ehsaas Therapy Centre (ETC), we believe in creating a world where healing is not just possible, but accessible, compassionate, and deeply transformative.
Our name, Ehsaas, meaning "feeling" or "experience," is central to everything we do. Our acronym, ETC, serves as a gentle reminder that there is so much more to each of us: more healing, more growth, more connection, more freedom, and more life to experience.

                </p>
                <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
                 We provide a therapeutic space that is trauma-informed, queer-affirmative, neurodivergent-aware, and sex-positive, honouring and celebrating the unique journeys of individuals.Our diverse therapeutic approaches are designed to help you build insight and process thoughts and emotions, safely and with compassion, fostering deeper healing.

                </p>
                <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                What truly distinguishes us is our unwavering commitment to building a safe space not only for our clients but also for our mental health professionals. We firmly believe that the well-being of therapists is integral to the quality of care they provide. Therefore, we ensure fair compensation, professional respect, and an emotionally supportive working environment without compromise.
We offer a wide range of therapists, each with unique expertise, language skills, lived experience, and therapeutic style, ensuring that care is not only competent but also truly affirming. Whether you're seeking cultural sensitivity, identity-affirming support, or a specialist in a particular area, we are here to match you with the right therapist. This ensures that clients can find a therapist who truly resonates with them. Because healing is not one-size-fits-all, and at ETC, we deeply respect that.

                    <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
                   As a psychologist, Priyadarshini firmly believes that a sense of safety is the foundation of healing. She is dedicated to creating a space where individuals, regardless of whether they identify as queer, neurodivergent, are exploring their identity, or are simply navigating their emotions, can feel a true sense of belonging. She emphasizes that every story is important and all feelings deserve acknowledgment.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
                      The inspiration for Ehsaas Therapy Centre arose not only from her passion for therapy but also from her observations during her training. Priyadarshini witnessed the challenges faced by psychology students and interns, including overwork, underpayment and instances of exploitation, such as having to pay for internships without gaining meaningful experience. This awareness motivated her to establish a different kind of space—one that prioritizes the well-being of both clients and mental health professionals alike. At ETC, therapists are deeply valued, fairly compensated, and receive the same level of support they are expected to provide to others.

                    </p>
                    <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                      At its core, Priyadarshini's philosophy is rooted in kindness, inclusivity, and the transformative power of feeling genuinely understood. She is dedicated to the idea that healing is possible for everyone and nobody should have to do it alone. Through Ehsaas Therapy Centre, Priyadarshini is committed to showing up for her clients, her fellow therapists, and a world where everyone can experience greater connectedness and deeper healing.
